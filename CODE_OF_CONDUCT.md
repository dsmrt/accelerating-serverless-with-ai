# Code of Conduct

Welcome to our little corner of GitHub. We're thrilled (truly) to have you here contributing. Please do read through this gentle reminder of how civilized folks behave in a community.

## Expectations

- **Respect:** It may shock you, but your opinions aren't the only valid ones. Kindly pretend you care about others' points of view, even if you think they're wrong.
- **Courtesy:** Do your best to be polite. It's surprisingly free, and trust us—being nice might actually feel good.
- **Constructive Feedback:** When offering feedback, try to sprinkle in some positivity between your critiques. We promise it won't hurt you.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We shouldn't have to list these, yet here we are:
- Insults, harassment, or generally unpleasant behavior.
- Condescending remarks. We're all trying our best—even you, believe it or not.
- Trolling or intentionally causing drama. This is GitHub, not reality TV.

## Reporting Issues

If you observe behavior that violates this code, please report it immediately. Yes, tattling is encouraged here, and we'll quietly judge you if you don't speak up.

## Enforcement

Violation of this Code of Conduct will lead to appropriate action, ranging from a gentle but firm "talking to" all the way to permanent removal from the community. Please don't force us to make that awkward for everyone involved.

## Final Thoughts

Remember, leaving your community to chase dreams of digital nomadism may seem romantic, but abandoning common decency here won't win you any admirers. Also, let's collectively sigh in disappointment at Matthew, our former meetup organizer, who decided community-building wasn't nearly as glamorous as living out of a backpack.

Stay classy.
